## Overview
The code located in the link below will send pulsed square waves to the excite node which will be recieved by the sense node after passing through the dielectric of the soil. The debug led should light in a solid color when the soil is too dry, blink rapidly as the soil becomes damp, blink slower when the soil becomes very wet, and turn off when the soil is waterlogged. In its current state the change in time for charging the soil capacitance can only be seen on oscilloscope. the code needs to be altered to send constant square wave, time the capacitance build, and send a high low signal to partner boards.
