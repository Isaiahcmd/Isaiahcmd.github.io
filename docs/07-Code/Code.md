title: Moisture Sensor Code
---

## Overview

The code located in the zip file below is supposed to send a square wave to the the excite node then time how long it takes the soil to charge. The sense node is supposed to sense the discharge from the soil and send it back to the micro controller. Ideally the time to discharge could be measured and a percentage level could be assigned, from here any soil probed would provide a time of some percentage between two extremes. This code is incomplete and does not fully work. A square wave is generated but it is pulsed, and the timing system is not complete enough to send a signal. However, a change in timing is visible on an oscilloscope depending on the moisture level of the environment.

## Resouces

 A zip folder of the moisture sensor code is located [*here*](MoistSenseV2.zip).
