## Version 2.0
The next version of this moisture sensing subsystem will be powered by a lithium potassium battery to allow for testing outside. An LCD display will be added to allow the testing team to easily check the readings the micro controller is recieving. A plastic housing will be 3d printed to protect the internal components from water and soil durning testing. The code will be reworked to allow full fuctionallity of the sensing, data display and data transmission.
