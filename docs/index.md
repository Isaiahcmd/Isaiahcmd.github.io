## Introduction

* These pages describe the construction and function of the moisture sensing PCB of the Garden Buddy smart irrigation system.

### Project Summary

* This capacitive moisture sensor provides data to the pump of the Garden Buddy, controlling the amount of water recived by the target pants.
* A data sheet detailing the full Garden Buddy system can be found [here.](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-201.github.io/)


### My Contribution

* Team 201 has developed a smart irrigation system to improve and streamline the workflow of hobbyist gardeners and small scale farmers.
* For a general view of the components of the sensor go to ["Block Diagram"](https://isaiahcmd.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/)
* For a descroption of the thought process behind compontents used for the sesor go to ["Component selection"](https://isaiahcmd.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/)
* For a list of the material used to construct the sensor go to ["BOM"](https://isaiahcmd.github.io/03-BOM/BOM/)
* To view the schematic of this sensor go to ["Schematic"](https://isaiahcmd.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/)
* To view a breakdown of how power moves through the sensor go to ["Power Budget"](https://isaiahcmd.github.io/05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/)
