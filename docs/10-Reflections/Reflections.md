## Lessons
Throughout this project much has been learned about idea conception and geration, project flow, prototyping, and documentation. When generating ideas its important to stay organized and document the process. The better and more thorough the idea generation and benchmarking the smoother the design process will go. 

Breadboard early and often to ensure the circuitry will work and the subsystem and product will fucntion. 

Ensure the product is being constantly worked on, tested, and improved. 

Document everything, at the end of each session of work make notes on what needs to be changed and updated in the digital documentation.

## Reflections: Idea Generation
When generating ideas, pick a sector or specific market that has a need not being met or that could be better met, write physical list to organize potential markets and products. Take the list and pick one. Research the existing products that solve (partially if not fully) the same problem. Look into these existing products and learn what customers think of them the good and the bad. List the good and bad aspects of the existing products, the more data the better. Aspects that more people talk about are more important than the one off mentions. During this step attempt to find, from the reviews, what type of customer (industrial, private, hobbyist) will be using the product to better specify user needs. Once user needs have been specified, brainstom designs using different combinations of the most importand user needs from different catagories. Start basic, dont try to put every dream feature into the product at once. Focus on basic functionality and getting the product to basically solve the problem. 

## Reflections: Schematic Design
Decide what type of components are needed for subsystem of the the product to function. Pros and cons the different components and create a full list of the components needed for the subsystem. Make the schematic, then if possible construct the circuit on a breadboard. The sooner the circuit can be constructed and tested the better. Use this time to begin coding as well. 

# Reflection: PCB
Once the circuit has been proofed and all adjustments have been made to the design, create and print the PCB. Ordering the PCB as soon as possible will be essential for success in EGR304. 

# Reflection: Documentation
Document early and often. After each session of work make some notes on paper to keep track of updates that need to be made to the digital documentation. Take pictures and video of all tests, breadboard setups, and PCBs.
