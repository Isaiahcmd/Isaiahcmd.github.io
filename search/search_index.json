Option 2. * Type: Parallel Plates* Manufacturer: Peralta (made in house) * Design use only * Easy to design and etch * Low cost  * Low risk of shorting * Low overall capacitance * Low range of measurement * Non-uniform sensing region (back and front of probe) Option 3.* Type: Multi-layer* Manufacturer: Peralta (made in house) * High sensitivity in bulk soil* Deep measurement* pairs can be chained to measure at different soil depths * Higher manufacturing tolerances* Higher cost* Probe stiffness makes it susceptible to cracking <p>Choice:Interdigitated Comb</p> <p>Rationale: The interdigitated comb design has a larger excite and sensing region when compared to a paralel plate design of the same volume. The comb design is easier and cheaper to manucatur than the layered design due to its acceptable tolerence range.</p> <p>Op-Amp Buffer</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.* LM358P* Op-Amp buffer* $0.27/eachDigikey * Resilient under heat* Low cost* High surge current tolerance * Higher Vf can reduce efficiency in dry soil* High junction capacitance* Bulky  Option 2. * CA3240EZ* Op-Amp buffer* $3.19/eachDigikey * Fast slew* Low input bias* Good bandwidth * Not rail to rail I/O* Noticable drift with temperature* Input noise  Option 3.* MCP6022-I/P* Op-Amp buffer* $1.86/each*Digikey *Low input bias* Fast slew* Low offset * Low drift with temperature rise*Small baseline drift*At risk of latchup potentially causing damage to the part <p>Choice: MCP6022-I/P</p> <p>Rationale: The MCP6022-I/P will be used for its low bias, and fast slew rate. Consuming minimal power and sending a clean signal.</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.* L7805CV* Linear Regulator* $0.50/eachDigikey * Lowest cost* Low noise* No switching spikes * Energy inefficient* Generates heat which could throw readings or introduce condensation* Higher idle drain  Option 2. * TSR 1-2450E* Switching Regulator* $3.40/eachDigikey * Low heat* Energy efficient* Low idle draw * Most expensive* Higher output ripple* Higher electromagnetic interference  Option 3.* LM2596S-5.0* Switching Regulator* $3.32/each*Digikey *Good efficiency* Operates in a wide voltage range* High current headroom * Noisier than other options* High Idle draw* Needs tuning/ Extra QA for productions runs <p>Choice:TSR 1-2450E</p> <p>Rationale: The TSR 1-2450E will be used for its efficiency in stepping down power while producing low heat, and stable output under load.</p> <p>Power Supply</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.* 16-00030 AC/DC WALL MOUNT ADAPTER 12V 6W* Wall outlet power supply* $6.77/each*Digikey *Lowest cost* Constant power* Clean supply * Not portable* Limited use without extension cords* Indoor use only  Option 2. * RadioMaster 5000mAh 2S 7.4V Li-ion Battery with XT30 Connector* Rechargeable power supply* $25.99/eachMotionRC * Long runtime* Compact* Easy connection * Highest cost* Performance loss at freezing and high heat* Risk of over voltage spikes  Option 3.* 2440 BATT HOLDER AA 4 CELL 6\" LEADS* Replacable power supply* $9.68/each*Digikey *User can easily replace cells* Low cost to replace cells* Safer for users than a Li-ion battery *Lower energy density* Not weather proof* More affected by weather than Li-ion <p>Choice:RadioMaster 5000mAh 2S 7.4V Li-ion Battery</p> <p>Rationale: The RadioMaster 5000mAh 2S 7.4V Li-ion Battery with XT30 Connector will be used for its long battery life and compact nature.</p> <p>Connector Header</p> Solution Pros Cons {width=70%)Option 1.* TB002-500-02BE TERMINAL BLOCK, SCREW TYPE, 5.00* Wire connection* $0.40/eachDigikey * Least expensive* Flexible connections* Secure connection * Bulky* Slower assembly/Slow production* Screws can back off with vibration  Option 2. * EBC04MMMD CONN CARDEDGE MALE 8POS 0.100* Board-to-board connection* $2.69/eachDigikey * Compact* Short signal path = good integrity* Makes board easily swapable * No flexibility* Most expensive* Non Locking  Option 3.* 215570-8 CONN DIP HDR IDC 8POS 28AWG PCB* Ribbon connection* $0.81/each*Digikey *Flexible connections* Fast attachment and detachment* Keyed to prevent incorrect plug in * Not sealed* Limited current* No strain relief <p>Choice:215570-8 CONN DIP HDR IDC 8POS 28AWG PCBP</p> <p>Rationale: The 215570-8 CONN DIP HDR IDC 8POS 28AWG PCB will be used for flexibility, modularity, and ease of assembly of the ribbon connection.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Moisture Sensor Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This bill of materials details the components necessary to construct the Garden Buddy moisture sensor subsystem.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"<p> Figure 2: Moisture Sensor Bill of Materials.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/","title":"Schematic","text":""},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This schematic is to support the construction and wiring of the sensing PCB of the Garden Buddy</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#resouces","title":"Resouces","text":"<p>The schematic as a PDF download is available here, and the Zip folder of the project here.</p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/","title":"Garden Buddy Power Budget","text":""},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This power budget describes the power needs of each major component</p> <p>Capture your power budge as a image to display.
